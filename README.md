# Beans
> what should I call my new keyboard project floss? Beans.

This is my working space for the Ergogen > kiCAD workflow.

## Progress:

### BeansV1
- Used Ergopad to create a rough mapping of where my fingers should go.
- Created an Ergogen yaml (relying heavily on work by flatfootfox and the Caldera).
- Set up the local Ergogen environment so running a commmand would generate a KiCAD PCB file with included footprints.
- Routed traces between everthing.
- Sent two halves of to JLCPCB to get made.
- Soldered all the components onto it (diodes, hotswap sockets, mill max pins and sockets, controllers, button, switch, battery header)
- Figure out how to create a ZMK firmware after much trial and error, and managed to flash both halves of keyboard. (currently typing this out on beans!)
- OUTSTANDING: afix the batteries and connect via bluetooth.

**Learnings thus far**
- The inter-column finger splay is extreme and actually quite uncomporable.
- The 5th thumbkey is probably redundant.
- The general spacing between keys should be a bit tighter.
- I should figure out how to get both sides made as one snap-off-able pcb.
- Mod-tap is wicked difficult to wrap my head around - currently only using shift/D.
- I should also figure out how to add holes for tenting. Also extra pcbs as baseplates.
- A soldering iron to a keycap makes a surprisingly effective homeing dot.
