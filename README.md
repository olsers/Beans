This is my working space for the Ergogen > kiCAD workflow.

---

##Progress:

###BeansV1
- Used Ergopad to create a rough mapping of where my fingers should go.
- Created an Ergogen yaml (relying heavily on work by flatfootfox and the Caldera).
- Set up the local Ergogen environment so running a commmand would generate a KiCAD PCB file with included footprints.
- Routed traces between everthing.
- Sent two halves of to JLCPCB to get made.
- Soldered all the components onto it (diodes, hotswap sockets, mill max pins and sockets, controllers, button, switch, battery header)

*in the process of figuring out the zmk fireware stuff*

**Learnings thus far**
- The inter column finger splay is extreme and actually quite uncomporable (from playing with it, not actually started typing properly yet).
- The 5th thumbkey is probably redundant.
- The general spacing between keys should be a bit tighter.
- I should figure out how to get both sides made as one snap-off-able pcb.
